# Algorithms
Algorithms which I know
Hi all,
I will be adding the alogithms which I know and describe it in the readme ,The algorithms will be in 2 languages i.e, Python and Java.to see the code go to their respective folder </br>

1.Insertion Sort <br>
Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm which is efficient when the data is small <br>
--------pseudo code----- <br>
InsertionSort(A)  <br>
  for i=1 to i=A.length
    key=A[i]
    j=i-1
    while j>=0 and A[j]>key
      A[j+1]=A[j]
      j=j-1
     A[j+1]=key
