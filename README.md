Algorithms which I know
Hi all,
I will be adding the alogithms which I know and describe it in the readme ,The algorithms will be in 2 languages i.e, Python and Java.to see the code go to their respective folder </br>

<h1>1.Insertion Sort </h1> <br>
Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm which is efficient when the data is small <br>
<h3>--------pseudo code-----</h3> <br>
InsertionSort(A)  <br>
  for i=1 to i=A.length <br>
    key=A[i]  <br>
    j=i-1 <br>
    while j>=0 and A[j]>key <br>
      A[j+1]=A[j] <br>
      j=j-1 <br>
     A[j+1]=key <br>
     end while
  end for
